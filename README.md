## Galaxy's Greatest Guardian

### Concept

A Space Invaders Game. 

You play as Gordon and Gayle, the Galaxy's Greatest Guardians, and the commanders and operators of the USS Guardia! Once again, Gayle and Gordon are being called to the front lines as Earth is under attack from the invaders of space! It's your job to give them a hand and defeat the baddies!

### My Approach

The basic outline for the game was first to create objects for the aliens and the Guardia (the player ship). After doing so, we would make a function to create a missile that would be fired from the player ship, and find a way to move the missile after it's been fired. Once the missile fire works properly, I needed to figure out how to get unit collision to work. 

The idea behind unit collision was to figure out a way to register that the missile has hit the enemy space craft and then have something happen (The enemy ship would dissappear). This was MUCH more difficult than I havd anticipated, however, I was eventually able to get the unit collision to work, for the most part.

### More to come!

As my game is not yet finished, there are a lot of things I still want to add to the game. Things like being able to move the player based on your mouse, rather than solely left to right, have the enemies move left and right on a timer, and eventually fire back, and of course, have the space ships dissappear when the missile collides into them. Getting the playing field to be reactive would also be a huge bonus.

### Challenges

The hardest part about the game was hands down getting the collision detection to work. I went through a lot of trial and error to figure out what exactly was going on behind the scenes with it, which ultimately helped me fix a lot of hidden problems I had with the game itself. While the actual function I created for collision detection was only a couple lines, I had to create a series of console logs to make make sure everything I had written was working properly, and I am so relieved to say that I finally got it to work.
